    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>Previously, I was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Brandeis University. During my
    three years, I supervised two PhD theses 
    (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-lu-365320149">Wei Lu</a> and
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhishek-gupta-1024/">Abhishek Gupta</a>),
    received an NSF grant, designed a new Applied Mathematics major and led colleagues in adopting
    and implementing it, and introduced new courses on optimization, Big Data, and communication
    skills. I left Brandeis in 2021 to relocate to Chicago with my family.</p>

    <p>From 2016-2018, I was a postdoc in the Algorithms and Randomness Center at
    Georgia Tech where I worked on provable guarantees for training neural
    networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with <a
     href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/">Santosh Vempala</a>
    and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/vigoda/">Eric Vigoda</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under the supervision
    of <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/">László Babai</a>. My thesis focused on faster algorithms for bottleneck cases
    of the graph isomorphism problem.</p>
