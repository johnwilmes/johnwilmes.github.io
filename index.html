    <h3>Research</h3>

    <p>I do research in algorithms, algebraic combinatorics, and machine
    learning. Current areas of focus are new training algorithms and provable
    guarantees for neural networks, and the structure and symmetries of highly
    regular combinatorial objects.</p>

    <h3>Background</h3>

    <p>Previously, I was a postdoc in the Algorithms and Randomness Center at
    Georgia Tech where I worked on provable guarantees for training neural
    networks and algorithmic problems in matching theory with <a
     href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vempala/">Santosh Vempala</a>
    and <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/home/vigoda/">Eric Vigoda</a>.
    </p>

    <p>I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago under the supervision
    of <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/">László Babai</a>. My thesis focused on faster algorithms for bottleneck cases
    of the graph isomorphism problem.</p>
