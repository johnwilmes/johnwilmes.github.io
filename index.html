    <p>I am an algorithms researcher and data scientist with experience in machine learning and
    Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. I'm currently available for work&mdash;get in touch!</p>

    <h4>Background</h4>

    <p>Over the course of three years as Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Brandeis University, I
    <ul>
        <li>designed a new Applied Mathematics major, collaborated across departments to win approval, and led colleagues in adopting
            and implementing it</li>
        <li>introduced new courses on optimization, big data, and communication skills to hundreds of students</li>
        <li>was awarded an NSF grant ("Guarantees for Training Neural Networks") for my machine learning research</li>
        <li>supervised two PhD theses</li>
    </ul>
    I left Brandeis in 2021 to relocate to Chicago with my family.</p>

    <p>Previously, I was a postdoc in the Algorithms and Randomness Center at
    Georgia Tech where I produced provable guarantees for training neural
    networks and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. My Ph.D. thesis at the University of Chicago
    introduced faster algorithms for bottleneck cases of the graph isomorphism problem.</p>
